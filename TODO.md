## Open points

### (what I would do if I'm given full control of the project)

- add `clsx` for easier conditional class management
- add Tanstack Query for data fetching and caching
- add git hooks with Husky and lint-staged for better commit consistency and code quality
- enable React Compiler for better performance
  - while Biome supports it add `eslint` and `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` (see [here](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/discussions/5290#discussioncomment-15267406))
- improve the design system using more consistent spacing, colors, typography, etc...
- add light/dark theme support
